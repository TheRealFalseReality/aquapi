## Calibrate EZO Circuits & Probes

Here are provided Calibration Configs for a number of EZO Circuits and their respective probes. It is recommended to only use the configuration for the specific probe to calibrate.

***NOTE: Do not mix up EZO circuit and probes once calibrated!!!*** The EZO circuit saves the calibration for the probe it was calibrated with.
